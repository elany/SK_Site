blurb: <p><strong>Everything is ink and everything hurts.</strong> Or how I decided to join this madness and didn't keep up with it for more than two days. Alternatively an exercise in obscure fandoms you never knew I'm a part of. A blog of many names. Actually it's just a doodle dump, but you didn't hear that from <a href="http://elany.tumblr.com">me</a>.</p>
